This project provides a simple SQL-based e-commerce database system consisting of three tables: customers, orders, and products. The project defines the table structure, relationships, and necessary queries to manage basic operations such as retrieving customer orders, product information, and order management. It also includes database normalization by adding an order_items table to handle orders in a more scalable manner.
